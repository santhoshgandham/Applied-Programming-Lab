If the packages numpy, matplotlib and scipy are not installed install it by running the following commands on terminal:

pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install scipy

After these are installed:

run the .py files by following command:

python3 <filename.py>

In this context the filenames are: [dataset1.py, dataset2.py, dataset3_1.py, dataset3_2.py]

You can run these on Jupyter notebook , pycharm or anyother software which supports the packaages we've installed.
